## üß© About the Project

This project implements a simple 2-player checkers game using a **bitboard** system in C.  
The goal was to use bitwise operations to represent and manipulate the board without arrays.  

The board is stored in 64 bits (`unsigned long long`) where each bit represents a square on the 8√ó8 board.  
Red and black pieces are moved using bitwise shifts and masks.
